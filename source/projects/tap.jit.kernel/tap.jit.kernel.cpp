/// @brief      tap.jit.kernel — generate a radial (gaussian-style) kernel matrix.
/// @details    A matrix generator (no matrix input, one matrix output). For every cell it computes
///             a radial falloff value from a configurable center, per-axis size, and overall weight,
///             producing a soft circular "blob". Faithful port of the original Jitter object, rebuilt
///             on Min's matrix_operator (MOP) path — since the object owns no matrix input, the SDK
///             treats it as a generator and drives calc_cell() for each output cell.
///
///             Provenance / faithful quirks reproduced from the 2003 original
///             (source/tap.jit.kernel/tap.jit.kernel.cpp on the `legacy` branch):
///               * The center[] and size[] components are intentionally swapped before use
///                 ("Not sure why, but these need to be reversed" — original comment), so attribute
///                 component 0 drives the y math and component 1 drives the x math. Preserved.
///               * size is applied as its reciprocal (1.0 / size), and weight as its reciprocal
///                 (1.0 / weight) — larger size/weight values therefore *shrink* the blob. Preserved.
///               * The horizontal axis is scaled by width and the vertical by height, but the
///                 original crosses these (row index against width, column index against height).
///                 Preserved exactly.
///               * The value is written only to plane 1; other planes are left untouched (for a
///                 freshly-allocated generator matrix that means 0). Preserved.
///               * BUG FIX: the original wrote each value to column (j-1), shifting the whole kernel
///                 one cell to the left and writing column 0's value to x = -1 (out of bounds — a
///                 stray write into the previous row / before the buffer). The MOP path writes the
///                 cell at its real coordinate, which removes the off-by-one and the OOB write. This
///                 is the one intentional behavioral change from the legacy code.
