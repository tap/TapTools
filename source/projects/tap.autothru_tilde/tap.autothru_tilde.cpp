/// @brief      tap.autothru~ — automatic signal pass-through.
/// @details    Passes the first inlet's signal straight through, unless a signal is connected to the
///             second inlet — in which case the second inlet is passed instead, cutting off the
///             first. Useful for building optional insert points. Faithful port — plain C++.
