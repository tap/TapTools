# TapTools Revival — Inventory & Plan

> Working document for bringing TapTools back to life in 2026.
> Status as of 2026-06-13. Branch: `claude/taptools-revival-xtc276`.

## 1. Where things actually stand

TapTools is a collection of **~48 shipping Max/MSP externals** (roots back to
1999; last substantive work 2014–2015; a lone README touch in 2020). The repo
is intact — nothing is lost. The "overwhelming mess" is really **three
half-finished migrations stacked on top of each other**:

| Era  | Attempt                                                | State                                   |
|------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 2013 | Monolithic → modular externals on **old Jamoma** (v4) | Shipped — this is the bulk              |
| 2014 | Pruned obsolete objects; vendored deps as git subtrees | Done                                    |
| 2015 | **Travis CI** + rewrite objects on **jamoma2**         | Abandoned after 1–2 objects             |

### The three real blockers

1. **Dead dependency.** 50 of 52 source objects are thin wrappers over the
   **old Jamoma** C++ library (`TTClassWrapperMax`, `TTDSPInit`, `TT(...)`).
   Jamoma is archived/dead. The 2015 escape hatch (jamoma2) is also abandoned
   *and* its submodule was never even cloned (`source/jamoma2` is empty). Only
   `tap.fourpole~` was ported to it.
2. **Dead build system.** Ruby (`build.rb`) driving Xcode projects + **Travis
   on Xcode 6.1**. Both long gone. Modern Max dev uses the **CMake-based
   `max-sdk-base`**.
3. **Dead binaries.** The checked-in `.mxo` files are `i386 + x86_64` — **no
   arm64**, so they don't run on any Apple Silicon Mac. Everything needs
   rebuilding regardless.

### Decisions locked in

- **Platforms:** macOS (Apple Silicon, universal arm64+x86_64) **and Windows**.
- **Dependency strategy:** **Cut Jamoma** — reimplement DSP standalone on the
  modern Max SDK. No dead dependency dragged along.
- **Scope:** review the full historical object set (current + retired +
  Jamoma-migrated) before committing to a per-object port list.

Only **`ttblue`** (a support lib, likely the SQLite glue for `tap.filecontainer`)
is currently Jamoma-free. Every shipping audio/utility object needs decoupling.

---

## 2. Currently in source (need Jamoma decoupling)

Effort tiers below are a **first-pass estimate** pending per-object code review.
"Cut" = reimplement the DSP/logic directly on the Max SDK.

### Tier 1 — Trivial utility / data (fast)
| Object | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| `tap.change` | Filter out repetitions (lists/symbols/numbers) |
| `tap.route` | A more flexible `route` |
| `tap.list.index` | Construct/decompose lists by element |
| `tap.sieve` | Only allow filtered values through |
| `tap.prime` | Generate prime numbers |
| `tap.bits` | Bit operations |
| `tap.gang` | Link objects together |
| `tap.random` | Floating-point RNG |
| `tap.radians~` | Convert to/from radians |
| `tap.inquisitor` | Interrogate another object's attributes |
| `tap.biquadcalc` | Calculate biquad coefficients |

### Tier 2 — Simple MSP DSP (moderate)
| Object | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| `tap.dcblock~` | DC offset filter |
| `tap.noise~` | Colored noise (white/pink/brown/blue/gauss) |
| `tap.pan~` | Stereo panner |

| `tap.zerox~` | Count zero crossings |
| `tap.width~` | Measure pulse width |
| `tap.sift~` | Sift samples to control rate |
| `tap.random~` | Signal-rate RNG |
| `tap.pulsesub~` | Pulse-based envelope substitution |

### Tier 3 — Complex DSP (heavier)
| Object | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| `tap.svf~` | State-variable filter w/ LFO modulation |
| `tap.comb~` | Comb filter with filtered feedback |
| `tap.fourpole~` | 4-pole ladder filter *(already on jamoma2 — will re-cut standalone)* |
| `tap.rotate` | (revived 2015) |
| `tap.verb~` | Reverb |
| `tap.limi~` | Look-ahead limiter |
| `tap.multitap~` | Self-contained multitap delay |
| `tap.procrastinate~` | Cascading delay effect |
| `tap.elixir~` | Gain-structure management |
| `tap.adsr~` | Envelope generator |
| `tap.shift~` | Pitch shifter |
| `tap.fft.binmodulator~` | Modulate FFT bins |
| `tap.fft.list~` | FFT analysis → list |
| `tap.fft.normalize~` | Normalize an FFT |
| `tap.buffer.peak~` | Hottest sample in a `buffer~` |
| `tap.buffer.record~` | Smooth recording to a `buffer~` |
| `tap.buffer.snap~` | Snap to zero-crossings in a `buffer~` |

### Jitter (need the Jitter SDK — separate sub-effort)
`tap.jit.ali` · `tap.jit.colortrack` · `tap.jit.kernel` · `tap.jit.proximity` · `tap.jit.sum`

### Special / infrastructure (investigate individually)
| Object | Note |
|--------|------|
| `tap.loader` | Package loader shim — **may be obsolete** under the modern Max package system; verify before porting |
| `tap.filecontainer` | Bundles files into a SQLite container (uses `ttblue`) |
| `tap.midimapper` | Map MIDI input to user-defined output |
| `tap.folder` | Filesystem create/delete/copy |
| `ttblue` | SQLite support library (already Jamoma-free) |

## 3. Formerly existed — retired but **documented** (real shipping objects, source removed)

These have surviving `.maxref.xml` docs and/or help patchers but no current
source. Strong candidates to **resurrect from docs + git history** if still useful:

| Object | What it did | Revive? (first take) |
|--------|-------------|----------------------|
| `tap.delay~` | Sample-accurate delay | ✅ classic, useful |
| `tap.delay` | Delay lists/symbols/numbers | ✅ useful |
| `tap.sustain~` | Sample-and-loop sounds | ✅ distinctive |
| `tap.vocoder~` | 24-band vocoder | ✅ high-value |
| `tap.spectra~` | Spectral remapping | ✅ distinctive |
| `tap.nr~` | Spectral noise reduction | ✅ high-value |
| `tap.5comb~` | 5× comb filter | maybe |
| `tap.adapt~` | (audio processor) | review |
| `tap.buffer.record2~` | Smooth buffer recording (v2) | merge into `tap.buffer.record~`? |
| `tap.smooth` | Data-stream smoother | maybe (native alts exist) |
| `tap.deviate` | Randomize & "prime" input | maybe |
| `tap.semitone2ratio` | Semitones → frequency ratio | trivial; maybe fold in |
| `tap.string.sub` | String substitution | maybe |
| `tap.thru` / `tap.thru~` | Feedback utilities | maybe |
| `tap.decay_calc` | Feedback coefficient calc | maybe (pair w/ `tap.biquadcalc`) |
| `tap.jit.delay` | Matrix-stream frame delay | Jitter tier |
| `tap.jit.motion` / `motion+` / `motion2` | Video motion detection | Jitter tier |
| `tap.jit.grayscale` | Grayscale conversion | Jitter tier (native alts exist) |
| `tap.jit.pan` | Video panner | Jitter tier |
| `tap.jit.getattributes` | Jitter abstraction helper | Jitter tier |

## 4. Formerly existed — retired (in git history, no current docs)

Recovered from `git log` (source was deleted). Most were intentionally retired:

`tap.applescript` · `tap.buffer.norm~` · `tap.buildassist` · `tap.colorspace` ·
`tap.decibels~` · `tap.diff~` · `tap.lfo~` · `tap.onepole~` · `tap.path` ·
`tap.pi` · `tap.pulserouter~` · `tap.quantize~` · `tap.twopole~`

## 5. Superseded / migrated (per historical changelog)

Documented as retired in favor of native Max or Jamoma — review for **repatriation**
now that Jamoma is also dormant:

| Old TapTools object | Was replaced by | Repatriate? |
|---------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| `tap.colorspace` | `j.unit` (Jamoma) | ⚠️ Jamoma dormant — candidate to bring back |
| `tap.decibels~` | `atodb~`/`dbtoa~` (native) or `j.unit~` | native covers it |
| `tap.onepole~` / `twopole~` / `fourpole~` | `tap.filter~` | `tap.filter~` itself isn't in source — see below |
| `tap.average~` | `average~` (native) | native covers it |
| `tap.degrade~` | `degrade~` (native) | native covers it |
| `tap.diff` | `gen~` | native covers it |
| `tap.path` | native path resolution | native covers it |
| `tap.buildassist` | Max Projects | obsolete |
| `tap.xml.sax` | `mxj` XmlParse | obsolete |
| `tap.svn` | (dropped) | obsolete |

> **Open thread — `tap.filter~`:** the changelog touts it as the flagship
> multichannel filter that replaced onepole/twopole/fourpole, but it is **not in
> the current source tree** and has no maxref. It likely lived in Jamoma
> (`j.filter~`?). Worth deciding whether to rebuild a unified `tap.filter~`
> standalone — it could absorb several of the individual filter objects.

> **Jamoma repatriation:** a deeper pass over the vendored `Core/` Jamoma
> modules (Foundation/DSP/AudioGraph/Modular) can identify `j.*` objects that
> originated from or pair with TapTools and are worth pulling back. Flagged as a
> follow-up survey, not part of the first build.

## 6. Recommended path

1. **Proof of life.** Stand up a modern **CMake + `max-sdk-base`** build and get
   **one** Tier-1 object compiling as a **universal macOS external** that loads
   in Max 9. Establishes the template every other object follows.
2. **Windows from day one.** Wire the same CMake build for Windows so we never
   bolt it on later.
3. **CI.** Replace Travis with **GitHub Actions** building both platforms.
4. **March the tiers.** Port Tier 1 → 2 → 3, then Jitter, then evaluate
   resurrecting the documented-but-retired set. Ship incrementally via GitHub
   releases / the Max Package Manager.
5. **Prune the corpse.** Once the new build proves out, remove the dead `Core/`
   Jamoma subtree, old Xcode projects, `build.rb`, Travis config, and stale
   `.mxo` binaries.

### Suggested first proof-of-life object
`tap.change` or `tap.prime` — Tier 1, no audio, minimal surface, exercises the
whole toolchain (build → package → load in Max) without DSP distractions.

## 7. Progress log

**Foundation decision (locked):** Build on **Min as a thin wrapper only** — Min
handles the Max plumbing (inlets/outlets, attributes, messages, the DSP perform
loop), while **all DSP is written as plain portable C++** with **no dependency on
`min-lib`**. Rationale: `min-api` + `max-sdk-base` are actively maintained (last
commit 2026-03-24) and compile clean against the current toolchain, but `min-lib`
is the under-maintained piece. Keeping DSP portable means shallow lock-in — the
wrapper is a small, swappable shim if Min ever stalls. Standard: **C++20**.
Targets: **macOS universal (arm64+x86_64) + Windows**, via CMake + GitHub Actions.

- ✅ **Modern build foundation** — root `CMakeLists.txt`, `min-api` submodule,
  GitHub Actions CI (mac+win), universal-binary verification. Replaces the
  retired Ruby/Xcode + Travis build. Dead `jamoma2` submodule removed.
- ✅ **`tap.change`** (Tier 1) — first object; proof of life. CI green; macOS
  binary verified universal.
- ✅ **`tap.dcblock~`** (Tier 2, DSP) — first full **vertical slice**: object +
  reference page (`docs/`) + help patcher (`help/`) + package layout. DSP is
  portable C++ (faithful to Jamoma's R=0.9997); `bypass`/`mute`/`clear`
  preserved.
- ✅ **Tier-1 batch** — `tap.prime`, `tap.sieve`, `tap.list.index`, `tap.bits`,
  each with object + reference page + help patcher. `tap.prime` ports Jamoma's
  exact `TTPrime` stepping; `tap.list.index` improves on the original (correctly
  handles symbol-leading lists). Ported reference pages + help patchers from the
  legacy package.

**Convention (tilde objects):** MSP objects whose Max name ends in `~` must have
their **project folder and `.cpp` named with `_tilde`** (e.g.
`source/projects/tap.dcblock_tilde/tap.dcblock_tilde.cpp`). The SDK maps the
project name back to `~` for the output binary, so the object still loads in Max
as `tap.dcblock~`, and its `docs/` + `help/` files keep the `~` name. This
applies to every remaining tilde object (`tap.noise~`, `tap.svf~`, …).

**Package layout:** the repo root is now the Min-DevKit-style package
(`externals/`, `docs/`, `help/`, generated `package-info.json`). The legacy
`TapTools/` subfolder and the dead `Core/` (old Jamoma), `max-sdk/`, `build.rb`,
`.travis.yml`, and stale `.mxo` binaries remain for now and will be pruned once
enough objects are migrated.
